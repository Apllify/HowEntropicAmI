# How Entropic Am I ?

This is a short project designed to show people 
how safe their passwords (or password ideas) are 
through the metric of information entropy. 

This is a hobby project for illustrative purposes and, as such, 
the entropy amounts may not be perfectly computed. A more 
reliable source (like the KeePassXC application) should be used 
for important tests.

DISCLAIMER : This application does NOT connect to the internet,
and in no way shares any information entered. Still, you probably
shouldn't put your real passwords in as a matter of general opsec.


# But what is entropy ? 
Entropy is a measure of how hard a given password
is to guess. "Guessing" here can refer to a range of methods from brute force
to more intelligent approaches.

Simply put, the higher the entropy, the more secure the password.

While there is no exact consensus, it's generally accepted that a good account 
password should have at least ~30 bits of entropy. For an important or high stakes 
password, that threshold is set much higher at around 80 bits of entropy.
